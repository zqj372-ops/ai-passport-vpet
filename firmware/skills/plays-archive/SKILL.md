# Archive an Application to plays

This skill archives a published application into the upstream
`FoloToy/ai-passport` repository's `plays/` application archive so it is
discoverable in-repository for later querying. It runs after a firmware release
(see `docs/development/release/publish-to-community.md` for publishing itself) and only
when the developer asks to archive the application.

## Safety and consent gate (run first)

Do not create, write, or commit anything until every gate below is satisfied.

1. **Confirm consent up front.** This work touches project-private content.
   Ask the developer to confirm they agree to archive the application. If they
   decline, stop immediately.
2. **Never modify or commit on the current branch.** Base the archive on the
   latest upstream `main` for a clean baseline, create a dedicated branch or
   worktree, push it to the developer's fork (`origin`), and open the PR from
   that fork branch against the upstream `FoloToy/ai-passport`. Leave the current
   checkout untouched.
3. **No credentials or private data.** Never include credentials, device QR
   secrets, private device links, personal data, or unsanitized logs. Run
   `python3 tools/check_repo.py` before committing anything.

## Determine what to archive

Confirm the application name, the source it belongs to (for example a `demo/*`
branch or `main/`), and the contributor's GitHub username. Use the
lowercase-kebab-case username and application name as the two-level path:
`plays/<username>/<app-name>/`. See
[`../../docs/reference/README.md`](../../docs/reference/README.md) for the full convention.

## Check the project README

Before generating the summary, check the **root README** of both the `main`
branch and the current branch:

- `git ls-tree --name-only main README.md` — is there a README on `main`?
- `test -f README.md` — is there a README on the current branch?

Follow the repository rule that the root README path is reserved for the fork
owner (see `docs/fork-guide.md`); do not create a root README unless the fork
actually owns one.

1. **If a README exists** (on `main` or the current branch): when archiving, **merge
   the README content into the functional summary** so the summary reflects the
   human-facing description, not just the code. A README that already exists is
   kept for the branch that owns it.
2. **If no README exists**: summarize directly from the implementation, with no
   README merge.
3. **After archiving is complete**, handle each branch's root README independently
   (not as a single combined decision):
   - For a branch with **no** root README, **create** (or update) the README on
     that branch so the archived application is discoverable from the fork's own
     README.
   - For a branch that already **has** a root README, **prompt the developer to
     update it** to reflect the new archived application.

## Generate the functional summary

First collect the metadata the developer filled in when publishing to the
community (bilingual title, bilingual description, and the source address they
submitted), then write `plays/<username>/<app-name>/README.md` and its paired
`.zh_CN.md` as an AI-generated functional summary for later querying (not a
publishing artifact). Record:

- **Publish title and description**: the bilingual title and description the
  developer submitted when publishing to the community.
- Application name and one-line positioning.
- What the app does and its feature list.
- Interaction and gameplay (buttons, screens, flow).
- Source, given as the **source address the developer submitted when
  publishing** (the HTTPS Git source page), so the application can be located
  precisely.
- The cover image file name and format, recorded as publish metadata only — the
  cover image itself is **not** committed (the archive is text-only).

If the root README exists, merge its content into the summary rather than
ignoring the human-facing description.

Write the default `.md` in English and the `.zh_CN.md` in Simplified Chinese,
aligned in the same change.

## Cover image

The archive is **text-only**: do **not** commit the cover image. Record only its
file name and format in the summary as publish metadata. The image itself lives
with the community publication; if a cover must be generated for the publication
(not the archive), use the official product references under
[`docs/brand/`](../../docs/brand/README.md): pass a reference (e.g.
`ai-passport-front.png` or a colorway shell render) as input to the generation
call, keep its shell, buttons, ports, and key-ring hole as they are, and redraw
only the reference's screen region into the play's actual on-screen content,
keeping the screen's size, aspect ratio, corners, and position identical to the
reference. See the full
convention in [`docs/brand/README.md`](../../docs/brand/README.md).

## Commit

Commit the summary on the dedicated branch (English imperative
Conventional Commit title, for example
`docs(plays): add <app-name> application archive`). If a root README was created
or updated, include it in the same change. Do **not** store the merged
firmware `.bin` here; it is a build/publish artifact. Report Build, Host tests,
Device tests, and Unverified separately.

After review, open the PR from the fork branch against the upstream
`FoloToy/ai-passport` through the first available GitHub channel — GitHub MCP, a
GitHub skill, or
`gh pr create --repo FoloToy/ai-passport --base main --head <fork>:<branch>` —
and read it back to confirm. Opening a PR requires separate confirmation.

## What this skill does not do

- It does not publish firmware or run the publisher workflow.
- It does not modify production source or the firmware.
- It does not store the firmware `.bin` binary.
- It does not store the cover image (the archive is text-only).
- It does not auto-submit anything without developer review and consent.
